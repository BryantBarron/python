# #Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# #The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# #The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
